# Weather-Globe

## Inspiration
- The lack - luster market and the less than stellar record whichin products of this sector have come to find themselves in, namely, the unruly and seemingly bloated UI's which are pervasive in the market category, whilst providing the user the functionality they want. This includes being able to search up for the specific area whichin they want to be informed of and the ability to dictate on a visualised globe where they want to be informed of in regards to weather. 

## What it does
- In its current inception, the web app accomplishes the first of those two major features, namely the ability to reference an open Weather API to where one would like to be informed about its current weather. 

## How we built it
- Built on React and Vite. 
## Challenges we ran into
- Be it overconfidence or zeal, it was decided that Raw React and Typescript handles would be the way by which we would create the app, which, to our shagrin, was ultimately too much. 
-- None of us had ever used TypeScript before this point, with none of us having used a proper frontend framework either. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Though be it the case that our goal certainly wasn't achieved in full, we did certainly do a lot of the groundwork which would be needed to accomplish that. 

## What we learned
- We can't code. 

## What's next for Globe Weather
- A dramatic UX and UI revamp. 
- A landing page.
